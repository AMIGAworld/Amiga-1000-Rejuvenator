Very preliminary... much to do here, stay tuned.

Mainboard:

CAS Header (U5M on mainboard):
    Rejuvenator holds _RGAE and _DAE high, and disconnects _ARW _ROME _PALOPE.
     _ARW leads to pin 16 of original Agnus socket, that pin is unused in Rejuv.
     _ROME connected to Rejuve via EN header, pin 13, then back up CAS header pin 7 where it is unconnected.
     _PALOPE is connected only to expansion port.  Exact function is unknown, perhaps never used.
             No equation present in DPALCAS (pin is nc). Not present in A2000.

EN Header (U5L on mainboard):
     Rejuvenator disconnects _DBR _DAE _RGAE _RE
     _DBR leads to pin 15 of original Agnus socket, that pin is unused in Rejuvenator.
     _DAE and _RGAE held high through mainboard connection to CAS header (see above)
     _RE still connected to Rejvenator via CAS header, pin 8.

  Because _RGAE is held high, LS244 U4J pins 1 and 19 are high.  Disables the Y outputs, leaving output pins in Z state.
  (Disables A1-8 Address lines from hitting the RGA bus)

  Because _DAE is held high, F374 U2H pin 1 is high.  Disables the OE, leaving the output pins in Z state.
  (Disables DRA lines from original Agnus from hitting the RA bus)

Clip Leads to Rejuvenator:
    RMBCLKS clip lead - Reset MainBoard CLocKs - Holds the mainboard clocks in reset using R8/C32 delay timer.  Allows
                        time for the Rejuvenator to initialize before the mainboard becomes active.
    28MHz - Gathers 28MHz from the mainboard.
    12V - 12V from the mainboard, for recharging the clock battery.




  Memory Config Jumpers:
    When using the ROM option (JP100 open), you can configure the mainboard RAM using the J101 and J102:
       J101 J102
        ON   ON   -  C00000 512kb    autoconfig (slow-fast RAM)
        ON   OFF  -  C00000 1Meg     autoconfig (slow-fast RAM) (if you have 1Meg Mainboard Hack?)
        OFF  ON   -  700000 512kb/1M addmem required
        OFF  OFF  -  A80000 512Kb/1M addmem required
             
    When JP100 is closed, Rejuvenator will store 256K ROM file from disk into the front RAM expansion.
    The remaining 256K on the mainboard can be moved to A0000 or 70000 by changing J101 and J102.
       J101 J102
        X    X    -  F00000-FFFFFF WCS 256K/512K Addmem
        OFF  ON   -  700000-7FFFFF Addmem Required
        OFF  OFF  -  A8000-B7FFF   Addmem Required
   

  Signals:

    _ROM01 - generated on pin 12 of U29, SBGCAS
    If _ROM01 is low: Enable the ROM chips at motherboard positions U2N, U2P, U5N, U5P.
    (ROM01 is connected to Pin 22 (OE) of all 4 ROM positions on the mainboard.

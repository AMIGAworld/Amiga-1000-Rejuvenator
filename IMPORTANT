Hey all,

I had inadvertantly uploaded the wrong KiCAD design files at first.  If you are having boards made, please make sure you use the
current artwork.  The initial upload contained a wandering VIA that stabbed the A7 and _CDRREJ lines, causing them to short.
The correct artwork was uploaded shortly after.  But if you are an early forker, please ensure you complete a DRC check before
having any boards made.

Finally, the current artwork is slightly different than the completed prototypes I had manufactured.  The notch is wider, the
hole is a larger diameter, and the board is slightly smaller to fit inside the Amiga 1000 better.  My originals had problems
with the A1000 capacitors fitting in the notch, and they had to be filed about 2mm in order to fit.  This has been corrected,
but new boards have not been built with the current changes.

I am continuing to improve the artwork, so just be warned, although the original was complete and tested, it is still being modified.

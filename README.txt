Amiga 1000 Rejuvenator Re-creation Project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any projects, additions, alterations, derivatives, or improvements based on this
Amiga-1000-Rejuvenator project must be openly shared, including software or PLD coding.
Additionally, on top of the LICENSE specified, the amigalove.com logo and Greg Tibbs name
must always be present in digital releases, and prominently printed on physical productions.

And with that out of the way...



Thanks to the extreme graciousness of Eric Hill (intric8 at amigalove.com), I had on loan
a Rejuvenator board for the Amiga 1000.  Originally created by Greg Tibbs, this Amiga 1000
hardware upgrade provides up to 2MB Chip Memory, an onboard ROM based kickstart, a video
slot, and additional Fast memory.  Installation requires replacing the A1000's
daughterboard with the Rejuvenator.

This project aims to re-create the original Rejuvenator, and eventually improve on the
design.

Schematics and board artwork are complete, and have been fabricated and tested.  Several
design errors on the original Rejuvenator which required bodge wires and trace cuts to
rectify have been identified and eliminated in the new design.

Again, thanks to the absolute determination of Eric over at amigalove.com, arrangements
were made to send the board overseas to Matthias Heinrichs of A1K.org who successfully
solved the last piece of the puzzle and has provided the PLD code.
 
 It has been an abosulute pleasure working with these Amiga community staples!
 
 So what now?  The project will continue with the goal of improving on the original
 design.  Currently, work is being done to provide compatibility with Agnus 8375
 varieties (-10, -11, -16, -17) and replace the DRAM with more available surface mount
 options.

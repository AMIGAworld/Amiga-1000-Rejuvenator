Amiga 1000 Rejuvenator Recreation Project
-----------------------------------------

Any projects, additions, alterations, or improvements based on this Amiga-1000-Rejuvenator project must be openly shared, including software or PLD coding.I belive the license I have specified in LICENSE equates to this, but I am not a license expert, so suggestions are welcomed.

Thanks to the extreme graciousness of intric8 at amigalove.com, I had on loan a Amiga 1000 Rejuvenator.  Originally created by Greg Tibbs, this Amiga 1000 hardware upgrade provides up to 2MB Chip Memory, an onboard ROM based kickstart, a video slot, and additional Fast memory.  Installation requires replacing the A1000's daughterboard with the Rejuvenator.

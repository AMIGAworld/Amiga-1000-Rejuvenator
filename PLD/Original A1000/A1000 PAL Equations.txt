The original A1000 PAL equations for DPALEN, DPALCAS, DAUGEN, and DAUGCAS are available
on the internet as scanned from the A1000 design sources.  However, the equations have
typos, missing operators, and are untested.  Here, I will attempt to re-create the
original equations to assist in Rejuvenator PAL decoding.

These equations are formated for WinCUPL, targetting Atmel ATF16V8 devices, but can be
easily modified for other compilers.

To do: Compile and test these in the Amiga 1000 to make sure we have an accurate baseline.
